Welcome to X3DOM's documentation. This documentation is divided into different
parts: Guide, Reference and Notes. We recommend that you read
the :ref:`gettingstarted` section of the Guide first.
Besides the getting started there is also a more detailed :ref:`firststeps`
tutorial that shows how to create complete (albeit small) application.
If you'd rather dive into the internals of X3DOM, check out
the :ref:`runtime_api` documentation.


Guide
