World of Warcraft Models to X3DOM
=================================

**WARNING: World of Warcraft Models are Blizzard property.** 
**You can not use them on your site without permission from Blizzard.**

The WOWModelViewer_ project is an open source application to create machinima with characters and models form the World of Warcraft MMORPG. One of its features is the ability to export models into various formats, two of them being X3D and X3DOM. The X3DOM option directly outputs an XHTML file with the appropriate header code. In its current released version 7.0.1 r462, only static models can be exported, but an option to export animations as well is already available in the code.

To export a model youâ€™ll need a full World of Warcraft installation (for instance a `10 day trial version <https://www.battle.net/account/creation/wow/signup/>`_) and the WOWModelViewer_. Open the application, select a model on the right hand side and click on *File->Export model->X3D* in XHTML.

The exported files can be viewed in a `X3DOM capable browser <http://www.x3dom.org/?page_id=9>`_.
